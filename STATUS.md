pluggable provider adapters. MIT license.

**Owner:** Alexander Chen ([@alexanderqchen](https://github.com/alexanderqchen))
**npm:** `orb-ui` (not yet published)
**Repo:** `github.com/alexanderqchen/orb-ui` ✅ pushed and public

## Git Log

```
01a9c0d  feat: implement circle and bars themes

## Build Order (what to do next, in order)

1. ~~**`circle` theme**~~ ✅ Done
2. ~~**`bars` theme**~~ ✅ Done
3. **Deploy demo to Vercel** — In progress.
4. **ElevenLabs adapter** — `onModeChange({ mode })` maps to speaking/listening; infer thinking from mode gap.
5. **Pipecat adapter** — WebRTC-based; map `botStartedSpeaking` / `botStoppedSpeaking` / `userStartedSpeaking`.
6. **Bland adapter** — Bland uses WebSocket events; map similarly.
7. **`jarvis` theme** — Sci-fi HUD. Canvas + WebGL. This is the launch demo — needs to be stunning.
8. **Demo site** — Interactive playground showing all themes + adapters. This is the marketing page.
9. **Push updates to GitHub, publish to npm** — Public launch.

## Core API (do not change without good reason)

```tsx
import { VoiceOrb } from 'orb-ui'
import { createVapiAdapter } from 'orb-ui/adapters'

// Adapter mode (recommended)
<VoiceOrb adapter={createVapiAdapter(vapiClient)} theme="jarvis" />

// Controlled mode (custom integrations)
<VoiceOrb state="listening" volume={0.7} theme="circle" />
```

### OrbState union
```ts
type OrbState = 'idle' | 'connecting' | 'listening' | 'thinking' | 'speaking' | 'error' | 'disconnected'
```

### OrbAdapter interface
```ts
interface OrbAdapter {
  subscribe(callbacks: {
    onStateChange: (state: OrbState) => void
    onVolumeChange: (volume: number) => void  // normalized 0–1
  }): () => void  // returns unsubscribe fn
}
```

## Key Decisions (don't re-debate these)

- **Single package, no monorepo** — `orb-ui` ships everything. Adapters are at `orb-ui/adapters`. Can split later.
- **No Framer Motion** — CSS + SVG for simple themes; Canvas/WebGL for jarvis. Keep bundle small.
- **Peer deps only for React** — Adapters use structural typing, not imports, so `@vapi-ai/web` etc. are never installed by orb-ui.
- **debug theme first** — Ships as Tier 0 so developers can integrate and test before pretty themes exist.
- **jarvis is the launch hero** — It's the sci-fi theme that makes the demo page go viral. Do it last so it's polished.
- **Volume is normalized 0–1** — All adapters must normalize before calling `onVolumeChange`.
- **Controlled props override adapter** — If both `state` prop and `adapter` are provided, the prop wins.
- **`thinking` state inference** — Vapi doesn't emit a thinking event; infer it from final user transcript. Other adapters may need similar patterns.
- **`connecting` state** — Vapi doesn't emit a connecting event either. The Vapi adapter intercepts `vapi.start()` to emit `'connecting'` immediately, then restores the original on unsubscribe.

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run build       # Build the library (tsc + vite)
npm run typecheck   # Type-check only, no emit
npm run dev         # Watch mode build
npm run test        # Vitest
cd demo && npm run dev  # Run interactive demo (requires demo/.env.local with Vapi keys)
```
